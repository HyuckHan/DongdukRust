# Lab 8

The goal of this lab is to make sure you are comfortable with Rust's Iterators and Closures.

This lab is more puzzle-oriented than the last few labs, where instead of implementing
one relatively complicated thing, you will implement 6 somewhat-less-complicated things.

Since you know how to read tests now, we encourage you to read some of the tests
_before_ you start writing any code.

All tests are located in `src/tests.rs`.
